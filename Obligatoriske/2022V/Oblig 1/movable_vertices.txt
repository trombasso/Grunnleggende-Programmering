(Two movable vertices and their distances) Write a program that displays two circles with radius 20 at locations 
(20, 20) and (120, 50) with a line connecting the two circles, as shown in Figure 11.25. The distance between 
the circles is displayed along the line. The user can drag a circle. When that happens, the circle and its line 
are moved and the distance between the circles is updated. Your program should not allow the circles to get too close. 
Keep them at least 70 pixels apart between the two circlesâ€™ centers.
